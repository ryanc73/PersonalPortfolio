      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Ryan, a front-end developer with a passion for creating seamless
        digital experiences that connect people and ideas. My journey has taken
        me through a variety of creative and collaborative spaces, from touring
        as a performer and working closely with sound engineers and venue teams
        to managing retail operations where attention to detail and
        communication were key. These experiences taught me the value of
        teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication—skills I bring to every
        project I tackle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I'm an avid photographer, capturing moments that tell
        stories, and a voracious reader of sci-fi, speculative fiction, history,
        and comics. These hobbies fuel my imagination and inspire me to approach
        design and problem-solving with a creative, future-focused mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe great work is born from collaboration, curiosity, and a
        genuine love for what you do—and I'm always excited to bring those
        values to the table. Let's build something amazing together!
